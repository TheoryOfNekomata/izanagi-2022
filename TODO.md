- [ ] Organize dependencies
- [X] Improve logging (remove SDL/lws dependency)
	- [ ] Remove `lwsl_user` calls
- [X] Unify memset/memcpy/free/malloc functions (remove SDL/lws dependency)
- [ ] Revisit unit tests
- [ ] Implement character sprites + animations
	- [ ] Finalize initial character sprite for rendering
		- [X] Acquire Affinity Designer (so we can move on from Corel)
- [ ] Implement SVG parser and manipulator (for animations) (should we implement stop-motion animation instead of interpolations for now?)
- [ ] Implement memory pool
- [ ] Fix gamepad mapping
	- [ ] Unify mapping (e.g. north button, west button for different buttons etc.)
	- [ ] Provide default mapping
	- [ ] Allow customization of button mappings
- [ ] Authentication server, using HTTP dynamic content
	- [ ] server
	- [ ] client (frontend)
- [ ] Proof-of-concept for fast SVG rendering (we're going to use SVG instead of Spine)
- [ ] Asset loading (finalize directory structure)
	- [ ] Allow modding mechanism file system (7-zip)
- [ ] Audio (SDL-mixer/Fmod)
	- [ ] Fmod for sfx and MIDI (with DSP)
	- [ ] https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile (load sound files as WAV, for Fmod playback)
- [ ] Network buffer structure (shared object in server)
- [ ] Gfx rendering API (bgfx, as long as not raw OpenGL) --- important, for Miyagi
	- [ ] Imgui-C for GUI
	- [ ] Define subcategories of rendering
		- 2d raster
		- 2d vector
		- 2d lighting system
		- 2d special effects (e.g. particles)
	- [ ] Animation system
		- [ ] How to trigger sounds, events, into keyframes
		- [ ] How to attach objects to different bones
- [ ] Physics (Box2D)
- [ ] Draft game design --- for neko
- [ ] Entity system
	- [ ] ECS/non-ECS
- [ ] Console (RCON) --- important (also for debugging) for Jed
	- [ ] Commands
	- [ ] Config
- [ ] Level editor (prefabs can be expressed in scripting system)
	- [ ] Level format (how to lay out level as data)
