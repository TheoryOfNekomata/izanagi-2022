`*` Codenames are for usable weapons only and can be equipped by both players and enemies. Unusable weapons are only equipped by enemies.

`**` Despite not having a dedicated weapon slot, the combat knife's codename is "Guerrilla".

# Trivia

- Servant is the only weapon to be dual-wielded. Also, it is the only weapon that the player does not use the knife when doing melee attacks because the player already has both hands holding the guns when they are dual-wielded.
- Hitman is the most powerful pistol, equating Impressor for power, but rarer to get.
- Ordinator normally has 12 rounds, but ammo crates and drops have extended magazines of 20 rounds, making it the most number of rounds of any pistol.
- Operative and Tactician are basically the same (MP5A5 and MP5KA1 respectively), but the former packing more power and a faster muzzle velocity yet has a slower rate of fire, while the latter has less power and slower muzzle velocity but faster rate of fire. When the player acquires both guns, their magazines can be interchangeable.
- Specialist can have scope attachments that can increase the firing range of the player. It also has the fastest rate of fire among automatic guns.
- Impressor is the only shotgun in the game.
- Militant is more likely to appear in map crates.
- Paragon is the only gun in the game with a grenade launcher.
- Enemies equipped with the Servant do not wield them dually.
